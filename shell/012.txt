    1.2 Create file nano-test.txt and explain command line options

    Explain what each of the option does by quoting manual page:

    nano -E -T 4 -i -I nano-test.txt

    Content:
    -E = Convert each typed tab to spaces
	  -T = Set the displayed tab length to number columns
	  -i = Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as the previous line
	  -I = Don’t look at the system’s nanorc file nor at the user’s nanorc

    # End of file
