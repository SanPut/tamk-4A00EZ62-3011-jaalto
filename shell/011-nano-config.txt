    1.1 The configuration file

    A. Where is user's personal configuration file located?
       For me it was in etc/nanorc

    B. Configure following settings permanently:

    # Set standard indenting to 4
    <set tabsize 4>

    # Use only SPACE characters for indentation
    <set tabstospaces>

    # Don't wrap text at the end of line
    <set nowrap>

    # End of file
